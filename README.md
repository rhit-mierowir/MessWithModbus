This is primarily for my Senior Design project and investigating how to use modbus using the scapy python library to emulate this traffic in a python script. 

This is just a place to house those scripts so I can point to them as needed.


Early on, I tried to understand how to use scapy:
- [Documentation Example Lab](https://www.scribd.com/document/419491885/craft-modbus?v=0.184)
    - Primarily impacted first_scapy_experiment.py

Then, I learned of pymodbus:
- [Blog example of a simulated atteck](https://mustafaalshawwa.com/posts/modbustcp/)
    - Primarily impacted in try_pymodbus/*
